    <h1>Homework 6-2</h1>
    <h2>Zack M.</h2>
    <h3>These maps represent the ratio of those covered by Health Insurance(2021) over Total Population (2020). I am doing this ratio
        as it is a representation of the total healthcare coverage post Obama care, and health insuracne matters for overall well-being.
        Some values may be over 100 as things like non-US citizens and cross county movements in Texas. These maps are by County in the Texas State Projection.</h3>

            <h2>Equal Count (Quartile)</h2>
            <h3>Equal Count (Quartile) is a method that tries to arrange groups so they have the same quantity. The pros of this are 
                that it allows for a clear viewing of the 5 groups by county, and includes them all. The cons are the inconsistent 
                ranges, which can make the map harder to understand without a legend.</h3>

            <h2>Equal Interval</h2>
            <h3>Equal Interval is a method that tries to arrange Sections so they have the same Interval amount. The pros of this are 
                that it allows for an even distribution of values within each section with symmetrical ranges. The cons are that the data
                can create an uneven distribution of values in each section, leading to most of the map being in one or another section(color)</h3>

            <h2>Natural Breaks (Jenks)</h2>
            <h3>Natural Breaks (Jenks) is a method that tries to reduce the variation in each section. The pros of this are 
                that it allows for a mostly even distribution of color. The cons are that sometimes a section can be left with no values due to there
                being only one.</h3>
