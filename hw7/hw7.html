    <h3>These maps represent the ratio of Monthly Home Costs. I took the yearly average home price I found through the National Assoication of Realtors
        and divided by 12 to get these values. I chose this as many family members I have in Texas, particularly San Antonio have described raising 
        home prices, so I wanted to see what it looked like. Some counties didn't have values. This map is in the Texas State Projection.</h3>
