    <h1>Homework 8</h1>
    <h2>Zack M.</h2>
    <h3>    This map shows the Electric Vehicle Charging Stations as points, a Convex Hull of those points, and two seperate buffers. My goal
        with this map was to answer and display how far someone could get by charging their EV for 1 minute or 5 minutes. To answer this I first
        created the convex hull to display the area in which you should always be able to charge your vehicle. I then used the Buffer tool to add a
        6.25 mile area around the polygon. Accoridng to google, 1 minute of charging equates to approx. 6.25 miles of distance, therefore the buffer 
        shows hwo far you can get from the stations with one minute of charging. The secondary buffer is the same principle but for 5 minutes of charging,
        or 31.25 miles.
